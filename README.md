# PBBtools: bioinformatic tools developed by the Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics group @ TU Braunschweig
This is a collection of tools developed by the [Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/ifp/pbb) group @ TU braunschweig. Many of these tools are available via our [BioinfToolServer](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/ifp/pbb/tools).

# Identification of Open Reading Frame
This script screens given nucleotide sequences for the longes Open Reading Frame (ORF) / coding sequence (CDS) that could encode a peptide sequence. The longest detected ORF/CDS per input sequence is reported.

# Translation of CDS into peptide sequence
This script reads all sequences from a given FASTA file and converts them into the corresponding peptide sequences.
